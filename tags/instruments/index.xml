      <description>For my talk at NSSpain 2020 I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a beyond-the-basics Timelane talk.
I think everyone who&amp;rsquo;s heard about Timelane by now knows what it does for its simplest use case - debugging some Combine based code. However, you can do much, much more with Timelane!

      <description>You can easily log data in Instruments by using the functions in Apple&amp;rsquo;s os framework. All you need is to use os_log(&amp;hellip;) and that will log data in Instruments. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to read more about this check out Recording Performance Data Apple article.
Creating a real custom instrument, however, is a little more complicated as you can learn in Creating Custom Instruments WWDC2018 video and it involves XML, CLIPS, and more complex stuff.</description>
