      <title>Bridge from Combine to AsyncSequence - the code (p. 2)</title>

      <description>Yesterday I wrote about AsyncSequence, AsyncStream and a simple plan how to bridge (or proxy) Combine publishers to the new asynchronous sequences APIs - Bridge from Combine to AsyncSequence - the plan (part 1).
Today let&amp;rsquo;s put together the code as planned and see if that&amp;rsquo;s going to work out so we can easily use publishers as async sequences.
CombineAsyncStream setup I&amp;rsquo;ll create a new type called CombineAsyncStream and make it conform to AsyncSequence.</description>

      <description>Previously, I wrote about actors in Actors part 1 and Actors part 2; this time I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover how to write a Combine operator to proxy a Combine publisher into an async sequence that you can iterate over by using a simple for loop.
 Note: The current version of Xcode 13 is beta 2 and I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using the latest swift.org toolchain nightly snapshot in order to make use of AsyncStream.</description>

      <description>In my previous post Swift Actors: A practical example, part 1 I covered how I got a Swift.org toolchain from trunk, enabled support for the currently experimental support for structured concurrency, and created a thread-safe cache in few lines of Swift code.
If you missed part 1, definitely do read it first as this post builds upon the code I already covered there. Â»
When I wrapped up writing part 1, I was looking at my new cache actor and I started wondering &amp;ldquo;What about Combine?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-reading the Swift structured concurrency roadmap and the Swift actors proposal and noticed a note on the latter saying:
 &amp;ldquo;Partially available in recent main snapshots behind the flag -Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency&amp;rdquo;
 So, naturally ðŸ¤“, I downloaded the latest snapshot from Swift.org and took it for a spin to try out some actor code!
Installing Swift toolchain with actors support  Huge disclaimer: this is all experimental experience using a trunk code not cut into a release.</description>
