      <description>In Simple custom Combine operators I spoke about how you can cheaply create your own custom Combine operator without the need to create a new custom Publisher type.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how this kind of &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; operators could actually be quite complex and useful; still being created only by creatively combining existing operators.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at sample(_)&amp;hellip;
The sample operator rxmarbles.com is a marveleous website where you can find visual and interactive presentations of a multitude of reactive operators (based in their implementation in RxJS).</description>

      <description>Creating simple custom operators is very straightforward in Combine.
As long as your custom operator can be expressed via combining existing operators you don&amp;rsquo;t need to create a new publisher type - you can simply extend the Publisher protocol with your own custom operator.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try quickly creating one now.
Extending Publisher You can extend Publisher like any other protocol in Swift. For this post I&amp;rsquo;ll create a debugging operator that writes logs to the system console.</description>
