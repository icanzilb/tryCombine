      <title>An assert operator: assertMaxSubscriptions()</title>

      <description>While I keep working on CombineDataSources I&amp;rsquo;ve faced some of the differences between RxSwift and Combine and those are slowing me down a bit.
For example: in RxSwift when dealing with UI I&amp;rsquo;d usually use shareReplayLatestWhileConnected() - this operator shares an observable and emits the latest value to all subscribers downstream. In Combine there is currently a share() operator which does a similar thing but does not &amp;ldquo;replay&amp;rdquo; the latest value.</description>

      <title>Debug logging with CombinePrintout</title>

      <description>Logging is a really powerful way to debug code, especially if it&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous code that runs in a time sensitive way so stepping through the debugger is a pain.
In Simple custom Combine operators I wrote about how to create an operator that logs to the system Console app in just few lines.
After playing with Combine some more I went ahead and created a micro framework called &amp;ldquo;CombinePrintout&amp;rdquo; that adds few convenient methods to Combine allowing you to quickly print information about your subscriptions.</description>

      <title>Building a custom `sample` operator</title>

      <description>In Simple custom Combine operators I spoke about how you can cheaply create your own custom Combine operator without the need to create a new custom Publisher type.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how this kind of &amp;ldquo;cheap&amp;rdquo; operators could actually be quite complex and useful; still being created only by creatively combining existing operators.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at sample(_)&amp;hellip;
The sample operator rxmarbles.com is a marveleous website where you can find visual and interactive presentations of a multitude of reactive operators (based in their implementation in RxJS).</description>

      <description>Creating simple custom operators is very straightforward in Combine.
As long as your custom operator can be expressed via combining existing operators you don&amp;rsquo;t need to create a new publisher type - you can simply extend the Publisher protocol with your own custom operator.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try quickly creating one now.
Extending Publisher You can extend Publisher like any other protocol in Swift. For this post I&amp;rsquo;ll create a debugging operator that writes logs to the system console.</description>
