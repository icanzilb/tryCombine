      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad to share that dataTile for Simulator is launching today on ProductHunt and the AppStore!
dataTile for Simulator is an Xcode companion app to see your debugging data in a beautiful and bold UI. Log your debug data as usual using Apple&amp;rsquo;s logging framework, and dataTile for Simulator will automatically select and display your logs!
It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful native developer tool that is focused on making developers more productive while developing with Xcode and the Simulator.</description>

Yesterday, I opened up dataTile for Simulator for public testing on TestFlight. If you want to give it a try or learn more, the website is:</description>
