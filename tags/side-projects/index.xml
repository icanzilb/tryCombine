      <description>Looking back at 2022, I worked on a whole lot of side projects. I do this mostly for learning purposes, solving problems that I personally have in my own workflow.
This year I did a lot of &amp;ldquo;development live threads&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;d make coffee in the morning and pull an idea out of my backlog and see how far can I get it by about lunch time. I post screenshots or comments every 10-20 minutes and a lot of people engage on twitter during the time.</description>
