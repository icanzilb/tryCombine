      <description>For my apps dataTile for Simulator and Rex Tables I have few command line tools that run some end-to-end tests. I use MarkCodable to easily print reports to the console. In this short post I&amp;rsquo;m gonna show how MarkCodable cuts down on some of the turnaround time when I&amp;rsquo;m making tools.
MarkCodable I wrote about MarkCodable previously when I released it: Introducing MarkCodable but I wanted to give you some more examples, just for fun.</description>

      <description>I had a lot of fun listening to &amp;ldquo;A releational database using Markdown&amp;rdquo; episode with John Sundell and Gui Rambo:
After taking a moment though, I started realizing that there is a whole plethora of use cases where Markdown could be a great storage for some of my data. Markdown supports tables and they are pretty easy to view, parse and edit by hand.
On the other hand, JSON isn&amp;rsquo;t very easy to view or edit by hand, which is sometimes more important for me, given I work on a lot of small tooling that automates or performs specific tasks and usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t need a large dataset.</description>
