      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two weeks since I released Timelane and I&amp;rsquo;m really humbled by the community&amp;rsquo;s super positive response.
Since much has happened since the launch, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this to give everyone a detailed update.
The current versions are as follows:
 TimelaneCombine 1.0.4 RxTimelane 1.0.3 TimelaneCore 1.0.3  I&amp;rsquo;ve merged 18 PRs (in the 14 days since launch!) on all Timelane repos and I pushed some changes myself too.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m announcing the public release of Timelane.
Timelane is a free, open source Instrument that helps you profile and debug asynchronous code.
Timelane is available today on: http://timelane.tools.
The Timelane Instrument leverages signpost logging and the powerful Instruments UI to help you visually inspect asynchronous subscriptions and drill down through logged events over time.
Installation Install the latest build from http://timelane.tools or fork the repository on GitHub and build the app yourself.</description>
