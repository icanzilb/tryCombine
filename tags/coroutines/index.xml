      <description>Note: This post is about a work-in-progress Swift language feature â€” the code works with a nightly build of the toolchain but might not work or work differently in the future!
  Edit: Correction accessors like _read and _modify are also available in release toolchains, they&amp;rsquo;re just _ prefixed to signify they are work-in-progress.
 It seems that Swift 5.6 is shaping up to a great iteration of the language and will bring a round improvements to performance-critical Swift code.</description>
