      <description>After I started doing some benchmarking how different APIs perform, when used to build a simple counter, I got really interested to learn more about how the new Swift concurrency model behaves at runtime.
So in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll use a couple of actors and make them do concurrent computations and check how the thread list and dispatch-queues look like in the debugger.
The Test Setup I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a super-duper simple SwiftUI app that does a bunch of floating-point multiplication and division.</description>

      <title>Performance: Actor vs queue vs lock</title>

      <description>I do a lot of performance and instrumenting work and I&amp;rsquo;ve found Peter Steinberger&amp;rsquo;s post here very useful when comparing lock alternatives.
As I worked with async/await and actors more and more this summer, I thought itâ€™d be nice to put together a short post offering some basic benchmarking of actors vs. the existing synchronization mechanisms.
Disclaimer Benchmarking depends heavily on the system, temporary conditions, and more. As with any amateur benchmarks, take the numbers in this post with a grain of salt.</description>
