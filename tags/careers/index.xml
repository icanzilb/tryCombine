      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m releasing a Safari extension on the Mac App Store called &amp;ldquo;Got Jobs?&amp;rdquo;.
This new extension lets you ask any website that you&amp;rsquo;re browsing: &amp;ldquo;Got Jobs?&amp;rdquo; by pressing Cmd+Shift+J.
That&amp;rsquo;s it. That&amp;rsquo;s the extension.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it since summer and it still sometimes feels like magic!
Got Jobs? &amp;ldquo;Got Jobs?&amp;rdquo; is a game-changing time saver for people who are actively or casually browsing for new opportunities.
This Safari extension makes finding and opening the Jobs/Careers page on the currently visited website as simple as pressing Cmd+Shift+J.</description>
